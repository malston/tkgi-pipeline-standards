## Tools for Standardization Enforcement

### 1. validate-repo-structure.sh

This tool checks if an existing repository conforms to our standardized structure. It performs various checks:

- **Directory Structure**: Ensures all required directories exist
- **Key Files**: Checks for presence of essential files like fly.sh, pipelines, etc.
- **Script Permissions**: Verifies that scripts have executable permissions
- **Pipeline Validity**: Checks if pipelines pass validation
- **Script Content**: Looks for expected patterns in scripts

Usage:
```bash
# Check the current repository
./validate-repo-structure.sh

# Check a specific repository
./validate-repo-structure.sh /path/to/repo
```

The tool will output:
- ✓ Green checkmarks for items that pass
- ⚠ Yellow warnings for optional items that are missing
- ✗ Red errors for required items that are missing

It provides a summary count of passes, warnings, and errors, and exits with a non-zero status code if any required elements are missing.

### 2. create-component-repo.sh

This tool creates a new component repository with the standardized structure. It:

- Creates all required directories (ci/, scripts/, release/, etc.)
- Sets up the fly.sh script with standardized commands
- Creates template pipeline, task, and Helm files
- Sets up utility scripts in the scripts/ directory
- Makes all scripts executable

Usage:
```bash
# Create a new repo for gatekeeper
./create-component-repo.sh gatekeeper

# Create in a specific location
./create-component-repo.sh istio ~/repos/istio-mgmt
```

The tool provides instructions for next steps, like initializing git and setting up the first pipeline.

## Implementation Strategy

To implement this standardization across your component repositories, I recommend:

1. **Create a Standards Repository**:
   - Create a repo named `tkgi-pipeline-standards`
   - Include both tools (`validate-repo-structure.sh` and `create-component-repo.sh`)
   - Add the example files and documentation

2. **For New Components**:
   - Use `create-component-repo.sh` to generate a repository with the standardized structure
   - Customize as needed for the specific component

3. **For Existing Components**:
   - Use `validate-repo-structure.sh` to identify deviations from the standard
   - Refactor the repository structure to conform to the standard
   - Re-run validation until all checks pass

4. **CI Integration**:
   - Add the validation tool to your CI pipelines
   - Fail the build if the repository doesn't conform to standards

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create detailed documentation on how to use the standardized structure
   - Include examples of common tasks and workflows

These tools will help ensure consistency across all your component repositories and make it easy for your team to follow the standardized approach.
