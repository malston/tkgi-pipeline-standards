# CI/CD Structure Migration Plans

This directory contains detailed migration plans and implementation guides for standardizing CI/CD structures across TKGi repositories. These plans serve as references for implementing the standards defined in the tkgi-pipeline-standards repository.

## Available Migration Plans

| Repository | Status | Implementation Branch | Documentation |
|------------|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| [ns-mgmt](ns-mgmt/README.md) | Completed | feature/standardize-ci-structure | [Implementation Guide](ns-mgmt/README.md) |
| cluster-mgmt | Planned | TBD | TBD |
| cert-mgmt | Planned | TBD | TBD |

## Migration Plan Structure

Each migration plan includes:

1. **Repository Overview**: Description of the repository's purpose and current structure
2. **Initial Assessment**: Analysis of the current state and identification of required changes
3. **Migration Approach**: Detailed steps for implementing the standardized structure
4. **Challenges and Solutions**: Common challenges encountered and their solutions
5. **Testing Strategy**: Approach for validating the migration
6. **Benefits**: Improvements gained from the standardization
7. **Lessons Learned**: Insights and recommendations for future migrations

## Using These Plans

These migration plans can be used as:

1. **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for migrating specific repositories
2. **Reference Examples**: Examples of how to structure CI/CD components according to standards
3. **Training Resources**: Educational resources for understanding CI/CD standardization

## Contributing

To add a new migration plan:

1. Create a new directory under `migration-plans/` with the repository name
2. Create a detailed README.md following the template structure
3. Include any supplementary materials (scripts, examples, etc.)
4. Update this main README.md to include the new migration plan

## Template Structure

Use the ns-mgmt migration plan as a template for creating new migration plans. The standard structure includes:

```
migration-plans/
└── repository-name/
    ├── README.md              # Detailed migration guide
    ├── scripts/               # Optional helper scripts
    │   └── ...
    └── examples/              # Optional example files
        └── ...
```
